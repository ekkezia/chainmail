# Chainmail
`chainmail` is a fashion editorial presented in the form of Instagram Story user interface. 

This project is exploring the idea that the audience should submit an effort in order to view the image. This makes the photography experience transactional-based instead of just one-way interaction where the photographer traditionally serves the image to the audience and they passively consume it. 

Each shot in the editorial will be revealed as a user submitted their social media handle, therefore, the number of the images that can be viewed publicly is depended on the number of the people that have participated in the social media collection form. The app is roughly following Instagram Story UI, and users can navigate from one story to another by clicking the next button. When a user reaches the latest revealed image, they will be prompted with a dialog that requests their social media handle to unlock the next shot. The participating usersâ€™ social media handles are listed in the top drawer menu, while the description of the image is displayed in the bottom drawer.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
